<h2>Background Context</h2>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure&rdquo; is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.</p>

<p>Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected</li>
<li>Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)</li>
</ul>
